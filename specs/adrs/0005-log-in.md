# Use Google or Email and Password for MVP Log In

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to allow users log in to our page so they can save their meal plan and favorites.
Should we use email and password login or Google integrated log in for the MVP?

## Considered Options

* Use Email and Password
* Use Google log in

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Use Email and Password, because

* We wanted to focus on main functionality and app features first
* One source of log in would be sufficient for the MVP
* Integrating Google might take too much time
