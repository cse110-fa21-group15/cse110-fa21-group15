# Include or Not Include Side Bar Quick Search Function

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to allow users to be able to search efficiently with little effort.
Should we include a quick search function in the side bar?

## Considered Options

* Include quick search
* Not include quick search

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Not include quick search, because

* It is redundant with the search bar which is accessible from every page
* It might potentially require a lot of coding to only save a few clicks
